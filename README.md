## ‚öô Configure settings
### We have now included new way of configuring settings.
- Built in app configurator

- Out side the file configurator (.ini)
  - Open PowerShell as administrator and enter the command below.

    ```powershell
    New-Item -Path "C:\Vitality" -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vojtikczhraje/Vitality/main/config.ini" -OutFile "C:\Vitality\config.ini"; C:\Vitality\config.ini
    ```
  - Change options to `True` for enabling options or `False` for disabling options
